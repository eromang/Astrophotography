name: recall
description: Load context from vault memory. Temporal queries (yesterday, last week, session history) use native JSONL timeline. Topic queries use QMD BM25 search. "recall graph" generates interactive temporal graph of sessions and files. Every recall ends with "One Thing" - the single highest-leverage next action synthesized from results. Use when user says "recall", "what did we work on", "load context about", "remember when we", "prime context", "yesterday", "what was I doing", "last week", "session history", "recall graph", "session graph".

# Recall Skill

Three modes: temporal (date-based session timeline), topic (BM25 search across QMD collections), and graph (interactive visualization of session-file relationships). Every recall ends with the **One Thing** - a concrete, highest-leverage next action synthesized from the results.

## What It Does

- **Temporal queries** ("yesterday", "last week", "what was I doing"): Scans native Claude Code JSONL files by date. Shows a table of sessions with time, message count, and first message. Expand any session for conversation details.
- **Topic queries** ("QMD video", "authentication"): BM25 search across sessions, notes, and daily logs in QMD collections.
- **Graph queries** ("graph yesterday", "graph last week"): Generates an interactive HTML graph showing sessions as nodes connected to files they touched. Sessions colored by day, files colored by folder. Clusters reveal related work streams, shared files show cross-session dependencies.
- **One Thing synthesis**: After presenting results, synthesizes the single most impactful next action based on what has momentum, what's blocked, and what's closest to done. Not generic - specific and actionable.

No custom setup needed for temporal recall - every Claude Code user has JSONL files.

## Auto-Indexing Setup (Optional)

Topic mode requires QMD collections. Temporal and graph modes work without this.

**1. Extract sessions to markdown:**
```bash
python3 .claude/skills/recall/scripts/extract-sessions.py --days 21
```

**2. Add to QMD collection:**
```bash
qmd collection add sessions 06_Metadata/Agents/Claude/claude-sessions-qmd '**/*.md'
qmd update && qmd embed
```

**3. (Optional) Auto-extract on session end** — add a Stop hook in `settings.local.json`:
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [{
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "python3 .claude/skills/recall/scripts/extract-sessions.py --days 7",
        "timeout": 15
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

## Usage

```
/recall yesterday
/recall last week
/recall 2026-02-25
/recall QMD video
/recall authentication work
```

**Graph mode** - visualize session relationships over time:
```
/recall graph yesterday        # what you touched today
/recall graph last week        # week overview - find clusters
/recall graph this week        # current week so far
/recall graph last 3 days      # recent activity window
```

Graph options: `--min-files 5` for cleaner graphs (only sessions touching 5+ files), `--all-projects` to scan beyond current vault.

See `workflows/recall.md` for routing logic and step-by-step process.
